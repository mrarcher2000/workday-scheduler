# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project is a Work Day Schedule Tracker that aims to help keep track of tasks throughout the day of normal working hours. The original HTML and functionality is based off of a mock up provided by the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. 

The webpage was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as with the Third-Party API's, jQuery, BootStrap, and Moment.js. While it is understood that Moment.js is a legacy project and no longer being added to on a regular basis, the mock up and given code used Moment.js as a starter and so the use was continued throughout the making of the webpage.

As of right now **the current code is not working**, but the project is undergoing updates to get the functionality wanted by the mock up designers and the University of Arizona.

The project can be accessed at https://mrarcher2000.github.io/workday-scheduler/.

## Installation

The project is available for common use at the above website or at https://mrarcher2000.github.io/workday-scheduler/.

## Usage 

This project is to be used to keep track of the time and and tasks through out the working day. The HTML page lists the hours of a normal work day (9 am - 5 pm) and saves tasks to the localStorage of the user's computer. The text areas for saving the day's tasks are color coded to be green for times that are in the future and red for the current hour. When the page is refreshed, the tasks stay in the same spot as they were when the page last visited. 

The page is supposed to audit the time every 15 minutes to update the color coding.
